# Spotify-Analysis-I
First approach to data analysis of my streaming history in 2021

After asking **spotify to send me my Streaming history** for the past year, we used _Data Wrangling tools in Jupyter Notebook_ in order to organize our songs.
Feel free to go through my code in **Streaming History Domingo.ipynb**. The comments in there are in Spanish.

My interest was to know my main bands, main songs, how much time to I spend in spotify, at what time of the day, and more.
In conclusion, this information is what spotify already sends you at the end of each year but with more detail!
This is a first approach to data Analysis through _Tableau_, hopefully in future repositories, more delicate analysis will be done.

For you to know, some extra subjects we could have added:
- Sentiment Analysis
- Audio feature Analysis
- Clusterization
- Predicting a song will be in our library
